Karem was born in Caracas in 1967, the first of five children. At age 11,she was sent to school in London, where she started painting, drawing, and capturing images, giving her creative ideas form.

As Karem grew up, she did not abandon her brushes. Becoming an International Professional Makeup Artist based out of New York City for more than 20 years, she transformed her subjects for special events, television, theater, fashion and advertising.

Her entrepreneurial endeavors have made Karem a successful business creator, co-founding and founding several companies.

Karem has amassed a body of art work which is divided into four periods. The first one is her first love, pencil and ink drawings on paper. Her early explorations showed an affinity for modern, minimalist and clean lines.

The second period consists of paintings on canvas, wood, paper, and other materials with mixed mediums. Her style is modern and abstract, showcasing bright and bold colors.

Her third is digital photography, concentrating in Fine Art. Her subjects range from portraits, landscapes, macros, botanicals and abstracts.

Her fourth period is Video Art, where she combines different technologies to expose and explore sensory limits. Using moving pictures with sound has opened a flood of possibilities for her artistic range.

No matter what professional hat Karem wears, she has never stopped doing art, exploring and discovering new ways to express her visions.
